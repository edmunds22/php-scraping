Basic and very messy php script for scraping url's for a given google search query.

It will then scrape each website for a title and contact email.

Disclaimer: I do NOT endorse scraping / google scraping as it is against the TOC. This script is an untested proof of concept.

Next steps: Try to find a contact page url within the site home page, then also scrape that for a more reliable email address.
